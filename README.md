# Deck

## Decription

The deck of the skateboard is where a person would stand. The board itself is 31" long and 9" wide with curved ends and filleted sides

## Reflection
Making the board was easy. Getting the ends to curve was a new challenge I had never tried. I learned how to apply the move face feature. I had to select the face that I wanted to move, which direction to move, and input the angle of rotation.

# Truck Baseplate

## Decription
This is going to attach to the Deck, Bushing, Truck hangar, and wheels.

## Reflection
Making this part was easy at first, but it then turned into a challenge. I hade to cut, add, and extrude parts in a very specific way.

# Truck hangar

## Decription
This is going to attach to the truck baseplate and wil hold the wheels.

## Reflection
The design easy and straight forward. I used prior techniques that I learned to extrude and add parts
# Bushing

## Decription
This will fit in between the baseplate and the hanger. The Bushing allows the sateboard to turn smoothly.

## Reflection
The bushing was the easiest part of the build. All that I did was extrude two circles slightly then added a fillet to the side.
# Wheels/bearings

## Decription
The wheels attach to the hangar and move the board. The bearings fit in between the wheels and the hangar. The bearings are responibe for moving the wheels

## Reflection
making the wheels and bearings was very easy. the wheel was just two circles extruded with a fillet on the sides, similar to the bushing design, with an extrude in the center to fit the bearing. The Bearing design is exatly the same as the wheels minus the fillet.
