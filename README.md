## Decription

The deck of the skateboard is where a person would stand. The board itself is 31" long and 9" wide with curved ends and filleted sides

## Reflection
Making the board was easy. Getting the ends to curve was a new challenge I had never tried. I learned how to apply the move face feature. I had to select the face that I wanted to move, which direction to move, and input the angle of rotation.

## Reflection
Making this part was easy at first, but it then turned into a challenge. I hade to cut, add, and extrude parts in a very specific way.
